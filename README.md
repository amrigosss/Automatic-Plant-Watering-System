Automatic Plant Watering System

An Arduino-based project that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels. 
This project reduces water waste and keeps plants healthy without the need for manual watering.

 Features
- Monitors soil moisture in real-time.
- Activates water pump when soil is dry.
- Automatically turns off pump when moisture is sufficient.
- Prevents both overwatering and underwatering.
- Energy and water-efficient.

 How It Works
1. A **soil moisture sensor** is inserted into the soil near the plant.  
2. The **Arduino microcontroller** reads the sensor data.  
3. If the soil moisture falls below the set threshold â†’ the **relay module** switches on the **water pump**.  
4. Pump delivers water until moisture is restored.  
5. System continuously monitors soil moisture to conserve water.
